## Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Nikolai!
 
I am an **aspiring applied physicist and engineer** with an **appreciation for nature**, and a **tinkerer at heart**.

I'm **looking for an internship** for the summer of 2024 that is applied physics and engineering-related, preferably something Research and Development oriented! 

I enjoy spending time going on adventures in the wilderness with a [camera by my side](/gallery).

I find satisfaction in building, flying, and ultimately crashing RC aircraft and drones. This passion for aviation prompted me to start an [aeronautics club](https://shmac.netlify.app/) at my high school.

Some of my other passions include, in no particular order, photography, content creation, drones, cryptocurrencies, electonics, programming, martial arts, languages, playing the guitar, and of course this website.
