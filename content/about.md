## Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Nikolai

I'm seeking a full-time job after graduation!

If you'd like to get in touch, email me at [nan34@cornell.edu](mailto:nan34@cornell.edu).

My [resume](Resume.pdf) and [portfolio](/portfolio) can be found in the menu above. 

I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering M.Eng. student at Cornell University, having completed a bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics also at Cornell in Dec. 2024. I will graduate with my M.Eng. in May 2025. I am eager to bring my background in physics and electrical engineering, my hands-on experience in software and hardware engineering particularly in the are of embedded systems and sensors, physics-based modeling and simulation, data analysis and visualization towards solving complex, open-ended problems.

I enjoy spending time going on adventures in the wilderness with a [camera by my side](/gallery).

Some of my other passions include, in no particular order, photography, content creation, UAVs, electronics, programming, martial arts, languages, playing the guitar, and of course this website.
