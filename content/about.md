## Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Nikolai!

I am a tinker and a doer. I thrive by working on complex and open-ended projects that challenge me.

I'm looking for an internship for the summer of 2024 that is applied physics and engineering-related, specifically something Research and Development oriented! 

I am a junior majoring in Physics with a concentration in Electrical Engineering at Cornell University. I plan to pursue a M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering to build up my engineering background and graduate with a Bachelor’s and Master’s in May 2025.

I enjoy spending time going on adventures in the wilderness with a [camera by my side](/gallery).

Some of my other passions include, in no particular order, photography, content creation, drones, cryptocurrencies, electronics, programming, martial arts, languages, playing the guitar, and of course this website.
