## Hi! Nice to meet you.

I'm Nikolai—an **aspiring engineer or physicist** with an **appreciation for nature**—a **tinkerer at heart**.

I enjoy spending time in the untouched wilderness with a [camera at my side](/gallery).

I also find satisfaction in building, flying, and ultimately crashing RC aircraft and drones. This passion for aviation prompted me to start an [aeronautics club](https://shmac.netlify.app/) at my high school.

Some of my other passions include, in no particular order, photography, content creation, drones, cryptocurrencies, electonics, programming, martial arts, languages, playing the guitar, and of course this website.

In fact, I've recently started a website devoted to [clarifying cryptocurrencies](https://cryptoclarified.netlify.app/) that also has documentation for a series of shell scripts that I wrote to simplify crypto mining called [*MinerWranger*](https://github.com/NikolaiTeslovich/minerwrangler).

I have also started my own series of Non-Fungible Tokens called [Nikolai in Nature](https://opensea.io/collection/nikolai-in-nature) inspired by *Um-Yang* and my appreciation of nature. Please be sure to **check it out** and **spread the word!**
