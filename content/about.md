Columbia Icefield, Jasper National Park

## Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Nikolai!

I'm seeking a full-time job after graduation!

If you'd like to get in touch, email me at [nan34@cornell.edu](mailto:nan34@cornell.edu).

My [resume](Resume.pdf) and [portfolio](Portfolio.pdf) can be found in the menu above. 

I am a senior Physics major at Cornell University, also pursuing a Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I will graduate with my Bachelorâ€™s in December 2024 and my M.Eng. in May 2025.

I have hands-on experience in hardware engineering, embedded systems, technical and user-facing documentation, data analysis and intuitive visualization. I thrive by tackling complex and open ended projects and problems that challenge me.

I enjoy spending time going on adventures in the wilderness with a [camera by my side](/gallery).

Some of my other passions include, in no particular order, photography, content creation, UAVs, electronics, programming, martial arts, languages, playing the guitar, and of course this website.
