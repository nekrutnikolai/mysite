Columbia Icefield, Jasper National Park

## Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Nikolai!

I am a senior Physics major at Cornell University, also pursuing a Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering through the Early M.Eng. program. I will graduate with my Bachelorâ€™s in December 2024 and my M.Eng. in May 2025. I am eager to bring my background in physics and electrical engineering, my hands-on experience in software and hardware engineering, physics-based modeling and simulation, data analysis and intuitive visualization towards solving problems. I thrive by working on complex and open-ended projects that challenge me.

I'm seeking a full-time job after graduation! If you'd like to get in touch, email me at [nekrutnikolai@gmail.com](mailto:nekrutnikolai@gmail.com).

I enjoy spending time going on adventures in the wilderness with a [camera by my side](/gallery).

Some of my other passions include, in no particular order, photography, content creation, UAVs, electronics, programming, martial arts, languages, playing the guitar, and of course this website.
