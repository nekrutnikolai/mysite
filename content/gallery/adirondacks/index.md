Went up to the Adirondacks with the girlfriend for the labor day long weekend. It's only 2 weeks into the semester and I definitely needed this break. 

The hike we went on was called Hurricane mountain and it was absolutely beautiful, definitely recommend it, especially the sketchy firetower up top that clearly is in need of some Loctite.
