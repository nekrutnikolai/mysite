      <description>Columbia Icefield, Jasper National Park
Hi, nice to meet you! I&amp;rsquo;m Nikolai! I am an aspiring applied physicist and engineer with an appreciation for nature, and a tinkerer at heart.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking for an internship for the summer of 2024 that is applied physics and engineering-related, preferably something Research and Development oriented!
I enjoy spending time going on adventures in the wilderness with a camera by my side.
I find satisfaction in building, flying, and ultimately crashing RC aircraft and drones.</description>

      <description>Formerly titled: How to Build a Website for Your Studio (or Anything): A Step by Step Guide
Introduction This guide is intended for Macintosh users who have never programmed before. With a bit of searching, the same steps can easily be applied to Windows and Linux machines.
Most will agree that a book is judged by its cover—for better or worse. Websites are the covers of your studio, organization, or even yourself, which are the books.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough sitting at home, not leaving my neighborhood for a week. So, I ventured out to Jo Hays Vista with my newly built FPV freestyle drone and camera at my side.
Unfortunately I forgot to charge the FPV goggles before hand, so the drone was practically useless. I&amp;rsquo;m still glad I saw the harsh, wind-chiseled ice.</description>

      <description>A massive ice storm just passed by State College. So while most people were scared of slipping and breaking an arm, I decided to venture out into the neighborhood and nearby golf course with my macro 35mm lens.
I find the texture of the ice fascinating—it resembles a network of plant cells, or looks like some carbonated drink.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I did something overly creative, like drawing circles with fire. So, here&amp;rsquo;s a remedy to that!
These were made by leaving the shutter open for a few seconds (30) and using my phone&amp;rsquo;s flashlight to draw while the sensor gathered light.</description>

      <description>Explored the areas around the frozen Lake Perez—where I used to sail in the summer—one of my favorite places of all time.
I also attempted the tilt-shift effect in Photoshop from a nearby overlook of State College. I think the house turned out the best!</description>

      <description>Happy New Year!
A major snowstorm recently unleashed its wrath on us, for a grand total of 14in or 35cm of fluffy, dry snow!
Here are some of my favorite long exposures from the evening.
Yes, you did notice something slightly different about this gallery. Actually, I probably already converted all of my existing galleries by now, so whatever.
I&amp;rsquo;m using a new system to generate these galleries. No longer do I have to deal with endless markdown tables!</description>

      <description>Here are some pictures of my friends over at @teamsketchyfpv flying some of their planes.
Thanks to them for inviting me, I had an absolute blast.
Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to get an RC jet!
And yes, we did keep at least six feet apart.</description>

      <description>Enjoy this video, I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of how it turned out!
I finally convinced my best friend to lend me his drone after days of trying.
I actually have a drone, an EMAX Tinyhawk 2, which note to self I still need to fix. I crashed it pretty hard flying on the porch of my house against a metal support beam and one of the ESC&amp;rsquo;s is burned out.
Enough about my drone.</description>

      <description>This was a project for my speech and debate class, the sources are in the video&amp;rsquo;s description.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the video version of the speech:
Here&amp;rsquo;s the transcript of the speech:
What do you think of when you hear the word “Bitcoin”? According to a 2017 YouGov survey, 62% of Americans believe that cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are used for illegal purchases or don’t know what they’re used for at all. Yet, all the cryptocurrencies combined are estimated to be worth about $230 billion.</description>

      <description>Note that this is not a build guide of the car itself. Rather, how to integrate the 3D printed parts with the plane parts for your own projects.
Printing the parts The parts can be found in the plans GitHub repo.
I recommend printing the All_parts_arranged.stl
I used an Ultimaker 3 to print the parts with eSun PLA+ at a 0.2mm layer height at 215C, 35% infill, along with a PETG brim for easy cleanup.</description>

      <description>Last night, I was listening to music on a vacuum tube amplifier that I assembled a while back from a kit.
I really liked the look of the tubes in dark, they had a very retro aesthetic. Since they glowed in a very gentle orange-red color, they were perfect for a long exposure.
Maybe it has to do with the look of these tubes, but I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that music sounds better on tubes than on a transistor amp.</description>

      <description>Today, I headed down to The Arboretum at Penn State to see what flowers and insects were in store for me.
At first, I decided to bring a 35mm macro lens. However, after seeing all of the dragonflies and lilies, I biked home in record time and snagged a telephoto lens.
I present to you the Water lilies and Dragonflies at The Arboretum at Penn State.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last played around with LEGO Technic. About 4 years to be exact. I can say with absolute confidence that this was my favorite way to spend time in my younger years.
I recollect building all sorts of crazy things from an automatic crossbow to a massive Mercedes Benz Unimog with a functioning suspension and a pneumatic crane. Over the years, I have acquired an impressive amount of LEGO technic parts that are still scattered everywhere around the house.</description>

      <description>I went camping with my family in the beautiful Northern PA countryside, near the finger lakes.
To celebrate the longest day of the year, I found a stick about my height and lit both ends of it on fire. It was similar to the staff that I use in Tang Soo Do, so I messed around with various techniques. Particularly, I really enjoy doing the figure-eight technique where you essentially spin the stick in the shape of an infinity sign.</description>

      <description>My friend&amp;rsquo;s Mac is nearing its end He&amp;rsquo;s already had it, the one in the picture above, for a couple of years, and the battery is starting to degrade among several other serious issues. Since it is nearing its end soon, in the time that it isn&amp;rsquo;t being used it could mine some cryptocurrency.
MacBooks are known for their subpar cooling systems as demonstrated in this video. We are going to set up this mac for mining Monero(XMR), a type of cryptocurrency that can be mined with a CPU.</description>

      <description>Hello World!
Why did I make this website and what even is it? I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked although you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t! I made and will continue to make this website because I want to learn how to build a website. I also enjoy writing, especially when it isn&amp;rsquo;t tied to a grade.
I will be posting about everything from a small cryptocurrency mining operation that I run in the basement to my favorite hobby of RC flight to my own ice cream recipes and everything in between.</description>
