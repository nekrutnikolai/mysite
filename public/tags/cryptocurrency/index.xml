      <description>My friend&amp;rsquo;s Mac is nearing its end He&amp;rsquo;s already had it, the one in the picture above, for a couple of years, and the battery is starting to degrade among several other serious issues. Since it is nearing its end soon, in the time that it isn&amp;rsquo;t being used it could mine some cryptocurrency.
MacBooks are known for their subpar cooling systems as demonstrated in this video. We are going to set up this mac for mining Monero(XMR), a type of cryptocurrency that can be mined with a CPU.</description>
