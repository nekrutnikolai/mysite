      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough sitting at home, not leaving my neighborhood for a week. So, I ventured out to Jo Hays Vista with my newly built FPV freestyle drone and camera at my side.
Unfortunately I forgot to charge the FPV goggles before hand, so the drone was practically useless. I&amp;rsquo;m still glad I saw the harsh, wind-chiseled ice.

      <description>A massive ice storm just passed by State College. So while most people were scared of slipping and breaking an arm, I decided to venture out into the neighborhood and nearby golf course with my macro 35mm lens.
I find the texture of the ice fascinating—it resembles a network of plant cells, or looks like some carbonated drink.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I did something overly creative, like drawing circles with fire. So, here&amp;rsquo;s a remedy to that!
These were made by leaving the shutter open for a few seconds (30) and using my phone&amp;rsquo;s flashlight to draw while the sensor gathered light.

      <description>Explored the areas around the frozen Lake Perez—where I used to sail in the summer—one of my favorite places of all time.
I also attempted the tilt-shift effect in Photoshop from a nearby overlook of State College. I think the house turned out the best!

      <description>Happy New Year!
A major snowstorm recently unleashed its wrath on us, for a grand total of 14in or 35cm of fluffy, dry snow!
Here are some of my favorite long exposures from the evening.

      <description>It was one of those fictional, silent winter mornings
14in or 35cm of fluffy, dry snow had just finished precipitating

      <description>Here are some pictures of my friends over at @teamsketchyfpv flying some of their planes.
Thanks to them for inviting me, I had an absolute blast.
Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to get an RC jet!
And yes, we did keep at least six feet apart.

      <description>I recently went on a camping/cabining trip with my family around New England, especially Maine.
I know there are a lot of photographs, but I really like all of these.

      <description>I walked around the garden and garage to see what pictures I could take. Here are the ones that I liked:

      <title>Vacuum Tube Amplifier</title>

      <description>Last night, I was listening to music on a vacuum tube amplifier that I assembled a while back from a kit.
I really liked the look of the tubes in dark, they had a very retro aesthetic. Since they glowed in a very gentle orange-red color, they were perfect for a long exposure.
Maybe it has to do with the look of these tubes, but I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that music sounds better on tubes than on a transistor amp.</description>

      <description>Today, I headed down to The Arboretum at Penn State to see what flowers and insects were in store for me.
At first, I decided to bring a 35mm macro lens. However, after seeing all of the dragonflies and lilies, I biked home in record time and snagged a telephoto lens.
I present to you the Water lilies and Dragonflies at The Arboretum at Penn State.

      <description>I went camping with my family in the beautiful Northern PA countryside, near the finger lakes.
To celebrate the longest day of the year, I found a stick about my height and lit both ends of it on fire. It was similar to the staff that I use in Tang Soo Do, so I messed around with various techniques. Particularly, I really enjoy doing the figure-eight technique where you essentially spin the stick in the shape of an infinity sign.</description>
